    Today we will learn about SMTP protocol :
* SMTP stand for Simple mail transfer protocol , this is the main protocol for sending emails
how actually it works , let's assume that you're sending an email to someone , you write the title , email message , files etc
then you press Send . so now your email is transfered to an SMTP server and it checks your email then send it to the target mail server ,
after when the recipient open his inbox he see the email using pop or imap

* SMTP is TCP protocol . TCP is Reliable because when you send an email , a connection will be opened and the TCP will ensure
the email delivery
